<p>
  The leading light in terms of what we're shooting for is the
  <strong>Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations.</strong>
  The <em>Protocol</em> defines an adequate preservation as respecting certain
  criteria.

      <div class="content">
        The Toolkit preserves content and authenticity proofs (SHA256 hashes of
        all files and bundles, a U.S. federal standard) separately and
        implements both the verification of an item and the lookup of a
        collection of items in the archive.

        The Toolkit ships with an example user interface implementing methods to

        In addition to implementing a user interface demonstrating its

A number of investigation-specific issues are also noted by the <em>Protocol</em> and
are at the heart of the Toolkit, driving its features:

<div class="tile is-parent">
  <article class="tile is-child notification">
    <p class="title">Chain of custody</p>
    <p class="subtitle">
      "The chronological documentation of the sequence of custodians of a piece
      of information or evidence"
    </p>
    <div class="content">
      By leveraging the ledger technology, the Toolkit implements a perfect log
      of everything that happens to the archive as it grows. The resulting log
      is immutable and as an implementation of a Merkle Tree, further
      intertwines each record's history with others' in the chain.

  </article>

<div class="tile is-parent">
  <article class="tile is-child notification">
    <p class="title">Evidentiary and Working copies:</p>
    <p class="subtitle">
      "A working copy should be created and stored separately so that
      investigators can work with the copy, rather than the original. Any and
      all changes to the item, including the making of copies, should be
      documented"
    </p>
    <div class="content">
      While accessing the originals manually is possible, the Toolkit and its
      user interface both implement the generation of working copies, on
      request. Automatic creation at the moment of addition to the archive is
      also possible. All changes can be documented in the ledger – see above:
      Chain of custody.

    <p class="title">Storage</p>

      "Helps ensure the persistence of digital items and the ability to find and
      retrieve them"
    </p>
    <div class="content">
      The Toolkit is built as a general-purpose solution where file management
      can be accomplished in different, from sensitive investigations conducted
      on one machine to full storage in the cloud from the point of record. We
      aim to leverage cloud technology and multiple duplication across
      data-centres to increase the reliability of the access to the originals.
