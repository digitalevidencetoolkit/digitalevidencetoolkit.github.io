German courts treat web archives with surprising sophistication – and surprising contradiction. Our newly compiled legal framework considers how civil proceedings demand stricter authentication than criminal cases, despite lower constitutional stakes. Notarised web captures receive presumptive authenticity[^1], while screenshots face judicial skepticism regardless of reliability.

The framework maps a fragmented landscape where mandatory electronic filing since 2022[^2] collides with authentication standards designed for analogue evidence. The Internet Archive gains approval for patent prior art[^3] but rejection for contract enforcement. Professional archiving services with qualified timestamps trump simple screenshots. eIDAS harmonisation accelerates acceptance, yet authentication infrastructure remains essential – not optional.

For practitioners navigating Germany's §286 ZPO[^4] free evaluation regime versus §371a ZPO's enhanced presumptions, this analysis decodes the authentication hierarchy determining whether digital evidence survives or fails. The dichotomy is stark: proper technical competence now separates winning arguments from malpractice liability.
