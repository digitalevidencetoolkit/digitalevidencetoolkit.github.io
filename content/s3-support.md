For relatively obvious reasons, we are working towards supporting teams and groups who wish to contribute to a single, collective repository of archived material.

The first step in this direction is to open up the data storage options, so archived records can be browsed by several people.

**We’ve just released [the Toolkit v.0.11.0](https://github.com/digitalevidencetoolkit/deptoolkit/releases) which now supports S3-class cloud storage as both a destination and a source – in plain English, the Toolkit can now replicate its archives to the cloud and serve data from it.**

There are still a number of things you can do to help:

* If you have experience with auth and auth-ing an existing product, please get in touch.
* Incidentally, devops skills and docker-fu would make a big difference in helping to scope and shape a more collaborative offering.
* We are always looking for folks to write unit and integration tests.

Thank you – and stay safe.
