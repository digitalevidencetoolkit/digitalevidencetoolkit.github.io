Every day, dedicated investigative journalists and human rights monitors scour the Web in search of proof of abuse, wrongdoing, and crime. The material they gather is at risk of being ruled inadmissible and dimissed out of hand in court.

Ahead of verification and authenticity concerns, preserving this material appropriately is a difficult problem drawing on several technically-advanced fields: from the high standards of the maintenance of the chain of custody to the cost of storage, the need for accessibility and availability of the material years into the future, the challenges are considerable â€“ and a lot for one organisation to take on.

<span class="f3 lh-title">The Digital Evidence Toolkit is an advocacy project bringing together scholars, experts, practitioners and activists.</span>

It aims:

- To raise awarness of the seriousness of the problem ;
- To offer a minimum viable product highlighting the basic requirements of proper evidence preservation ;
- To highlight different challenges and solutions fitting different organisations and fields.
