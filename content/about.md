## About our funding

The original version of the Toolkit was built and released in August 2021 with the support of **Prototype Fund**, the **German Federal Ministry for Education and Research**, the **Open Knowledge Foundation**, with an additional contribution from **Amazon Web Services.**

We are open to additional funding if it aligns with [our roadmap objectives](https://github.com/orgs/digitalevidencetoolkit/projects/3).
