The Digital Evidence Preservation Toolkit (DEPT) WordPress Plugin transforms WordPress into a secure, verifiable evidence management system, allowing teams to capture, authenticate, and manage digital content with built-in chain-of-custody tracking and court-ready exports.

Whether you’re an investigative journalist, a legal professional, or a compliance officer, our plugin ensures that every piece of digital evidence is verifiable and tamper-proof.

### How It Works

Built with PHP and TypeScript, the DEPT WordPress Plugin integrates with your WordPress CMS and enables automatic tracking and verification of all content changes.

Using SHA-256 and CID hashing as well as a tamper-evident, append-only immutable database, each modification's provenance is recorded and tracked. The goal: to make your diligent research auditable and verifiable.

Through their familiar Wordpress user interface, users can annotate, track revisions, and generate court-admissible reports with full chain-of-custody documentation.

For multimedia and enhanced proof of authorship, the plugin incorporates Content Credentials (C2PA), ensuring that all media includes secure, verifiable identity markers.

The plugin uses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) to handle conflicts between revisions, caused by several authors. Every edit is captured as a cryptographically signed operation with unique identifiers and logical timestamps. This enables:

- A complete audit trail – Every edit is individually tracked and verifiable;
- Automatic conflict resolution – Changes from multiple editors merge without conflicts;
- Bandwidth efficiency – Only the minimal necessary data is transmitted during synchronization.

#### High Level Architecture

The plugin's architecture places content provenance and legal verification at the forefront:

1. Each edit operation is individually signed before leaving the WordPress site;
2. Operations are stored in a tamper-evident sequence;
3. Operations synchronize with our secure verification service;
4. Merkle tree verification ensures that all operations remain unaltered;
5. Cryptographic receipts provide court-admissible proof of content authenticity.
