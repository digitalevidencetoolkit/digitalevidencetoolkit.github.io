### How It Works

Built with PHP and JavaScript, the DEPT WordPress Plugin seamlessly integrates with your WordPress media library and enables automatic metadata analysis upon file upload. Using SHA-256 hashing and a tamper-proof ledger database (QLDB or alternative immutable storage), each file’s authenticity is recorded and tracked.

For enhanced proof of authorship, the plugin incorporates Content Credentials (C2PA), ensuring that digital files include secure, verifiable identity markers. Through the admin dashboard, users can annotate, track revisions, and generate court-admissible reports with full chain-of-custody documentation.
